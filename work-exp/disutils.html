        Around when I started my degree, me and some of my friends decided on
        making a service for the popular social media app - Discord, which
        specialized in making bots for various purposes to enhance user
        experience on the app. We made bots related to music, moderation, games,
        etc.
        <br /><br />
        I was the lead developer for all our bots. I had brought about a lot of
        code quality improvements and optimizations. There were many challenges
        and road blocks that we had hit but we managed to come up with unique
        solutions to get by them. One of the more challenging problems we had
        faced was, repeating code in all our bots. All of our bots had the same
        core features, like a help command, embeds system, cooldown system, a
        common base view, etc. The problem was that if we ever had to make any
        changes to these common features in any one of these bots, we'd have to
        copy paste those changes in all of our bots. This was a tedious process
        and was error prone.
        <br /><br />
        That's when I had come up with a solution of taking all the core common
        systems - modularizing them and package them into an open source
        library, called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/disckit/">disckit</a>.
        We then simply make that library into a dependancy for all our bots.
        This solved all of our issues with repeating code & maintainability.
        Other than just solving our problem, the library also became quite
        popular, stacking up +16k installs. <br /><br />
        After making and updating our bots for more than a year, we finally
        decided to shutdown our service on December of 2025. Mainly because most
        of our team members got busy in their own life and academics, including
        me. But in the end, all of us came out of this project as much better
        developers.
