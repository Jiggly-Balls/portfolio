        During my time with the disutils team, we also took on commissions to
        build custom bots. One such project was the
        <a href="https://www.ceebs.site">Ceebs Project</a>. Ceebs is a platform
        developed for Monash University that enables students to create or
        accept delivery tasks from fellow students, allowing them to earn money
        in their free time. I initially served as the lead developer, where I
        was responsible for designing and implementing all core features over
        the course of several months. <br /><br />
        As I began to experience burnout while balancing both commission work
        and my responsibilities with disutils, I brought another developer from
        Monash University onto the project. He showed strong interest in the
        platform, and from that point onward, I mentored him and collaborated
        closely with him, which significantly streamlined the development
        process.
        <br /><br />
        Once he became comfortable with the codebase, I entrusted him with full
        ownership of the project and stepped away. After working on Ceebs for
        approximately five months, I felt my personal growth had plateaued and
        that I could no longer dedicate sufficient time to my own projects.
        Nevertheless, Ceebs was a highly engaging project, and I’m grateful to
        Lachlan Nguyen for the opportunity. Through this experience, I gained
        valuable hands-on knowledge in integrating multiple APIs and systems,
        including Stripe, user verification workflows, and developing a custom
        asynchronous API that interfaced with Airtable.
