      <h2>About me-</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Krish Mohan Muruganandam. I was born and raised in Oman
        in an Indian family. I got into programming during COVID-19, when my mom
        enrolled me in a Python class run by her friend. Since then, I've been
        building small projects and games and steadily expanding my skills.
        <br /><br />
        I'm currently in India pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer
        Science Engineering, and I'm always excited to explore and learn more
        about this ever-evolving world of technology.

        Over the years, I've worked on countless projects—but these are the ones
        that stand out the most to me.
